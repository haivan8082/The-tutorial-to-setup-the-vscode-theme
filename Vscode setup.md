so today i'm here to help you how can i make this vscode look like this , so to do it ,

First: Click the setting icon , click settings , in the search bar type "Caret animation" and click on the checkbox to enable it.

Therefore , in the search bar type "Blinking" and click on the bar and choose "Expand" (you can choose other) .

So easy for a first step.

Second:

+) In the "extensions" search "Wallpaper loader" , and install it. Then reload the vscode by "ctrl + shift + p" and type "reload" and click on it . in the bottom bar , you will see the icon of the wallpaper loader , click on it and choose "load wallpaper" and choose the image you want to be your wallpaper. Yah so good and reload the vscode again.

+) In the extensions , search "Material Icon Theme" and install it. Then reload the vscode again and you will see the icon of the folder and file changed to the icon of the material icon theme. (but you can use a city light icon theme if you want , i think it good because it can show the icon like the programming language and the file type) .

+) In the extensions , search "Doki theme" and install it , then reload the vscode again , you can choose the theme by click the setting icon and choose color theme , type "Doki" it have many theme of the anime character you like , and enable the wallpaper and the sticker you can "Ctrl+Shift+P" and type the anime character name same as the theme of the anime character you want to setup such as my "rikka" wallpaper and sticker i have setup .

+) In the extensions , search "Vscode Animation" and install it , you will see the notice need to install custom css and js , but you should click the "change install method" and choose the "Apc Customize UI++" so you can see a new notice and click on the "Install now" button and wait it to reload the vscode , you will have the animation to your vscode , it is better than the vscode not has the animation. (But if you don't successful , you can see the \*Note i will write in more steps) .

Third:(\*Note)

(\*)if you want you file bar look like me you must to install "custom css and js" . next you create a file "custom.css" and click thi link here and copy the source code to the custom.css(the source code can help you fix the bug animation ) : "https://github.com/haivan8082/The-tutorial-to-setup-the-vscode-theme/blob/main/custom.css"
